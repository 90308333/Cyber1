Marsupial is born in a very incomplete state. 
They are minute, blond, hairless and with hindlimbs only partially formed. 
The forelimbs however are developed, and the toes are armed with sharp, curved claws. 
They use these claws to make the journey to the pouch, many times the body length of the one month old foetus.
There are over 330 species of marsupials
Around two-thirds of them live in Australia. The other third live mostly in South America
